Here you can find some basic Markdown syntax guidance and specific guidance for using Markdown in Azure DevOps features. You can use both common Markdown conventions and GitHub-flavored extensions.

Having the right guidance at the right time is critical to success. Use Markdown to add rich formatting, tables, and images to your project pages, README files, dashboards, and pull request comments.

For more supported syntax for wiki pages, see Wiki Markdown guidance.

You can provide guidance in the following areas using Markdown:

Project wiki
Publish code as wiki
Markdown widget added to a dashboard
Project page or Welcome pages
Repository README files
Pull request (PR) comments
Definition of Done (Kanban board)

Not all Markdown syntax is supported across all features. Each section in this article identifies the features and the syntax supported with the Supported in line.

Headers
Supported in: Definition of Done | Markdown widget | Pull Requests | README files | Wikis
Structure your comments using headers. Headers segment longer comments, making them easier to read.

Start a line with a hash character # to set a heading. Organize your remarks with subheadings by starting a line with more hash characters, for example, ####. You can use up to six levels of headings.
